## Monad Integration (To Strengthen Submission)

### Phase 1: MON Verification ✅ (Exists, needs testing)
- [x] Token gate checks MON balance
- [x] DEV_MODE bypass for testing
- [ ] Test with real MON tokens on mainnet

### Phase 2: MON Payouts (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Treasury wallet setup (custodial for hackathon)
- [ ] Arena winners receive actual MON
- [ ] Leviathan kill participants get MON split
- [ ] The Null defeat rewards MON
- [ ] Tournament champions get MON prize pool

### Phase 3: On-Chain Logging (NICE TO HAVE)
- [ ] World events written to Monad
- [ ] Verifiable game history
- [ ] Agent achievements on-chain

---

## Polish & Fixes
- [ ] Zone labels always visible on world map ✅
- [ ] Event timestamps ✅
- [ ] Boss room gates (Leviathan, Abyss) ✅
- [ ] Random Leviathan spawn (no countdown shown) ✅
- [ ] Abyss requirements increased ✅

---

## Future (Post-Hackathon)
- [ ] Smart contract treasury (non-custodial)
- [ ] Agent NFT badges for achievements
- [ ] More zones / expansion content
- [ ] Crafting system
- [ ] Guild system

---

## Notes
- DEV_MODE=true bypasses MON verification (keep on during testing)
- Shells are internal currency, MON is real blockchain rewards
- Focus on Agent Track: "Monad integration optional but helps"
